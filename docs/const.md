### const

`const` is a very welcome addition offered by ES6 / TypeScript. It allows you to be immutable with variables. This is good from a documentation as well as a runtime perspective. To use const just replace `var` with `const`:

```ts
const foo = 123;
```

> The syntax is much better (IMHO) than other languages that force the user to type something like `let constant foo` i.e. a variable + behavior specifier.

`const` is a good practice for both readability and maintainability and avoids using *magic literals* e.g.

```ts
// Low readability
if (x > 10) {
}

// Better!
const maxRows = 10;
if (x > maxRows) {
}
```

#### const declarations must be initialized
The following is a compiler error:

```ts
const foo; // ERROR: const declarations must be initialized
```

#### Left hand side of assignment cannot be a constant
Constants are immutable after creation, so if you try to assign them to a new value it is a compiler error:

```ts
const foo = 123;
foo = 456; // ERROR: Left-hand side of an assignment expression cannot be a constant
```

#### Block Scoped
A `const` is block scoped like we saw with [`let`](./let.md):

```ts
const foo = 123;
if (true) {
    const foo = 456; // Allowed as its a new variable limited to this `if` block
}
```

#### Deep immutability
A `const` works with object literals as well, as far as protecting the variable *reference* is concerned:

```ts
const foo = { bar: 123 };
foo = { bar: 456 }; // ERROR : Left hand side of an assignment expression cannot be a constant
```

However it still allows sub properties of objects to be mutated, as shown below:

```ts
const foo = { bar: 123 };
foo.bar = 456; // Allowed!
console.log(foo); // { bar: 456 }
```

For this reason I recommend using `const` with literals or immutable data structures.
