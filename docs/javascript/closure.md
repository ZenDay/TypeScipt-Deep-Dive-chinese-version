## Closure

The best thing that JavaScript ever got was closures. A function in JavaScript has access to any variables defined in the outer scope. Closures are best explained with examples:

```ts
function outerFunction(arg) {
    var variableInOuterFunction = arg;

    function bar() {
        console.log(variableInOuterFunction); // Access a variable from the outer scope
    }

    // Call the local function to demonstrate that it has access to arg
    bar();
}

outerFunction("hello closure"); // logs hello closure!
```

You can see that the inner function has access to a variable (variableInOuterFunction) from the outer scope. The variables in the outer function have been closed by (or bound in) the inner function. Hence the term **closure**. The concept in itself is simple enough and pretty intuitive.

Now the awesome part: The inner function can access the variables from the outer scope *even after the outer function has returned*. This is because the variables are still bound in the inner function and not dependent on the outer function. Again let's look at an example:

```ts
function outerFunction(arg) {
    var variableInOuterFunction = arg;
    return function() {
        console.log(variableInOuterFunction);
    }
}

var innerFunction = outerFunction("hello closure!");

// Note the outerFunction has returned
innerFunction(); // logs hello closure!
```

### Reason why its awesome
It allows you to compose objects easily e.g. the revealing module pattern:

```ts
function createCounter() {
    let val = 0;
    return {
        increment() { val++ },
        getVal() { return val }
    }
}

let counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getVal()); // 1
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getVal()); // 2
```

At a high level it is also what makes something like nodejs possible (don't worry if it doesn't click in your brain right now. It will eventually ðŸŒ¹):

```ts
// Pseudo code to explain the concept
server.on(function handler(req, res) {
    loadData(req.id).then(function(data) {
        // the `res` has been closed over and is available
        res.send(data);
    })
});
```
