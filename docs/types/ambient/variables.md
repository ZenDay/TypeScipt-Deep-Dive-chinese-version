### Variables
For example to tell TypeScript about the [`process` variable](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html) you *can* do:

```ts
declare var process:any;
```

> You don't *need* to do this for `process` as there is already a [community maintained `node.d.ts`](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/node/node.d.ts)

This allows you to use the `process` variable without TypeScript complaining:

```ts
process.exit()
```

We recommend using an interface wherever possible e.g:

```ts
interface Process {
    exit(code?:number):void;
}
declare var process: Process;
```

This allows other people to *extend* the nature of these global variables while still telling TypeScript about such modifications. E.g. consider the following case where we add an `exitWithLogging` function to process for our amusement:

```ts
interface Process {
    exitWithLogging(code?:number):void;
}
process.exitWithLogging = function() {
    console.log("exiting");
    process.exit.apply(process,arguments);
}
```

Lets look at interfaces in a bit more detail next.
